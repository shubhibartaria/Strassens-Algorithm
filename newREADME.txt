For the Lab, the code was written in python3 and can be executed as follows on command line:

python3 <filename.py>

example for my program:

python3 Strassensmod.py

Please follow the prompts for inputting the input filename and the output
filename and different choices for the leaf size and whether to run the 
normal matrix multiplication or not. If the inputs are not correct, it
will show an appropriate message. The output file can be checked for the
extent of execution to infer where the error was exactly.
